Dialogflow Chatbot for Social Activity Evaluation in Deaf Youths

The Flow 'Smalltalk' can possibly be extended with more options to provide more lengthy conversations if so wished.
Entity types are defined per flow to reduce ambiguity and make result processing way easier (in comparison to sleepcoach)

Entities eluding to introversion or extraversion are chosen to reflect the current scientific consensus on these character types and may be used to assess the need for lengthier or more brief social contacts or conversation lengths in each individual.
